*Inpired by this video from Russian creator: https://youtu.be/BwcznghxxHk?si=dKYFBOzIPwtE7SWY*

**Aim and Motivation**
1) Get closer to building more real-life related projects and services
2) Train muscle memory and overall speed of completing React/NextJS projects. Knowing the design beforehand saves a lot of time and headache, when all that's left to do is look at design choices, program the design with some adjustments of my own taste and focus more on the logic 
3) It is a good and interesting challenge for me, since obviously chat apps are extemely popular and the most important is I want my questions to be answered. Such as how do developers come up with unusual shapes for messages, do they use actual plain CSS or finished solutions? When to use HTTP requests and when to use sockets for interactions between users? How is chat and user data typically stored in such projects? No BS, it's a lot of overwhelming questions I have in my head, but only by doing something that I have never done before and at current stage can't imagine doing, only this would allow me to achieve significant improvements in the field, making all the things I previously learnt very simple compared to new information
4) Observe how much more experienced person makes various decisions and explains their thinking processes, try to understand what is going on in their head, their priorities and strategies. Since I don't have a programming job yet, this is one of very few possibilities that I can do currently to get a lot better at what I do, by combining typical "tutorial watching" with building something by myself and analysing the decisions done by tutorial creator. Nobody is perfect and only by doing and analyzing I could spot mistakes and areas for improvement and form my own way of doing things  
5) Better understanding of React and NextJS App Router. It is a good and demanded skill, especially after recent change from Pages to App Router with addition of Server Actions and replacement of previous functions related to props and params. Doing different projects and observing what community has to teach you and their observations of new React and Next.js features is much more valuable than reading documentation, which doesn't show practical reasoning behind those features and their applications

**What have I learnt**
- Existence of react-hook-form and react-form-toast libraries when doing authentication througn registration and login forms. While I am skeptical about adding dependencies for something I could more or less easily program myself, I do like the idea of deligating extremely repetitive code to such libraries to do it much quicker and clearer
- Linking similar fetch() requests into same file using OOP. While I am not new to concept of OOP, I found it to be extemely short and clear to create and export istance of a class with all related requests, instead of writing these functions as separate API routes as adviced by NextJS. It also attempts to reduce number of API routes like Server Actions do, but isn't limited to POST requests and helps to separate the internal logic from logic of API routes meant to be accessed externally


**Big part of code here copies the video. What did I do differently?** 
1) Simplified styling. In the video he creates a lot of small separate SCSS files for components with CSS properties along with Tailwind's @apply directive. While it's commonly used, it is even discoouraged by Tailwind's maker himself.
- Instead, I have a single "index.css" file to define @font-face directives
- Use that separate "index.css" file to apply font-side, font-family and other general CSS properties or Tailwind classes to main HTML elements like <html> and <body>
- When it comes to more complicated CSS code like animations (@keyframe directive) with many arbitrary values or a set of Tailwind Classes which are extremely reusable within the app, index.css file is suitable for defining those things. In my experience, Theme Extend in "tailwind.config.ts" helps to replace CSS variables and come up with reusable Tailwind Classes there instead of on separate .css/.scss file
2) Clearer use and application of Tailwind Classes. Video's creator writes either writes CSS and Tailwind on small separate files near his components. While writing Tailwind directly within HTML/JSX is conventional, it pollutes the code and not everyone on developer team may have extensions to hide/unhide these classes. 
- Instead I use a strategy from my previous project which is Mangopost Website (it got its issues and weaknesses due to being my first Next.js project, but shows some interesting reusable programming techniques anyway) where Tailwind classes are written as string values within an object/dictionary and later accessed in JSX 
- Storing Tailwind classes in separate object named "styling" puts all classes near each other, which enables quick editing and styling control for both parent and children components. Instead JSX includes more conditional logic, rendering and style application making the big picture much clearer
- Additionally another Tailwind styling strategy from my Mangopost Website will be used in this project, where child components will have their wrapper elements (like wrapper <div> elements) inside parent components, which allows quicker layout control from "styling" object of the parent. *E.g: main component for webpage includes other big 4 <section> components located in 4 other .jsx/.tsx files. Would you rather copy paste the styles for <section> elements into different files and edit them one by one and having them not match sometimes due to a small mistake or keep them all within parent component? I would store them in parent component. I prefer to open and edit specific <section>'s and components on separate files only when their styling or logic is unique*. As other Next.js content creator ByteGrad states (not a direct quote): There has to be one source of truth in React. I agree, when programming logic and styling are shared between components, it better be kept and accessed in one place and having multiple similar sources of truth in React is distracting and goes against its reusability principles
3) Less complicated folder structure. Video's author uses a separate 'Components' folder which arguably helps the structure and readability, but in practice requires more time to switch between folders and files in App Router to folders and files in "Components" folder outside of App Router
- I keep all components in App Router, which allows Private Folders (with <_folderName> syntax) and is ignored by routing system, making it suitable for storing layout and UI components
- Also components don't need to be stores in separate folders, they can be placed in same directory page.tsx and layout.tsx files they belong to and as long as they don't have reserved names (like page.tsx, layout.tsx, route.tsx) they will be ignored by routing system. Keeping components and related files closer to one another leads to better organization and imrpoved readability
4) Database and user information will be managed in Next.js instead of Strapi. While Video's author wanted to use finished solution, I am not yet experienced enough in native Next.js, REST API and OAth 2.0 concepts and for my personal development I would rather do things manually at least this time, till I get better at it
- Instead of Strapi, I will use node-postgres to manage connections to PostgreSQL
- Instead of Strapi, I will manually make user connections and roles using a separate table in PostgreSQL
